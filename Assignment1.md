# Difference between the 7-layer OSI reference model and the TCP/IP model.

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP model are basic frameworks describing how information is transmitted between two devices across a network. Both models define a set of layers, each of which performs a specific set of functions to enable the transmission of data. They guide the design and operation of computer networks. The following are the differences between them:

1.  Focus and Design: The OSI Model was designed as a general-purpose model, which led to its more detailed and granular seven-layered structure. Each layer has a clearly defined function.

2. Layer Structure: OSI: Comprises seven layers, each with specific tasks. These levels are, from top to bottom: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. TCP/IP: Features a more simple four-layer model: Application, Transport, Internet, and Link.
